## 📄 Abstract

This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of thermospheric density variability using satellite data from ESA's Swarm mission. The study focuses on quantifying the influence of solar and geomagnetic activity on spatial-temporal density patterns in the thermosphere. By correlating density data with key indices such as F10.7, Kp, and Dst, and evaluating discrepancies between observations and empirical models (e.g., NRLMSISE-00), the work contributes to a deeper understanding of space weather effects on low Earth orbit dynamics.
